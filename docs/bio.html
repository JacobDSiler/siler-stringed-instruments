      Dennis Siler has studied and practiced luthery, or the building of stringed musical instruments, for almost 40 years. In 1980 he completed a formal apprenticeship in Nashville Tennessee with master luthiers Mike Lennon and Bruce Scotten who had both worked for stringed instrument guru George Gruhn.<br />  Dennis operated Siler’s Stringed Instruments in Conway Arkansas from 1980-84, and afterward worked as the chief repair and restoration specialist for Jack’s Music, also in Conway. Over the years, Dennis has constructed guitars, mandolins, banjos, dulcimers, harps, Native American flutes and several other instruments. One of his octave mandolins built on the pattern of a Renaissance cittern is played by actors at the American Shakespeare Center. Dennis’s instruments are played around the continental U.S., while some have landed as far away as Hawaii, China, and Ireland.
      <br />While he no longer works as a luthier full time, Dennis still completes a few instruments each year by consignment, and also takes on repair and restoration work by appointment.
